              Welcome to my project section, where I showcase my favorite projects that I've been
              working on. It's like a virtual playground, but instead of monkey bars and seesaws,
              you'll find a collection of my personal training projects, which I've created to flex
              my coding muscles and demonstrate specific skills. I also have a few gems from my past
              work projects, but be warned, some of them might be classified as "ugly babies" â€“ you
              know, the kind of project that you love because it's yours, but wouldn't show to
              anyone else.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, let's talk about what you can expect to find here. Some of the projects include
              links to their website and source code, so you can check them out for yourself and see
              how they work. Others only have a picture and description because I don't have
              permission to share the code after leaving the job. I promise I'm not trying to hoard
              any coding secrets, but sometimes that's just the way the cookie crumbles.
            </p>
            <p>
              But wait, there's more! I'm always working on new projects and adding them to this
              section, so stay tuned for updates. Who knows, maybe you'll find something here that
              sparks your interest and inspires you to create your own projects. After all,
              imitation is the sincerest form of flattery (;

          <template #header> Prefect Cloud | Server </template>
          <template #content>
            <p>
              During my time at Prefect, I worked on the development of Prefect Cloud and Prefect
              Server, two applications aimed at making data flow control more efficient and
              user-friendly for our clients. For certain projects, I was the sole UI Lead Engineer
              and responsible for leading the development of several pages and features for both
              applications.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the main goals of the project was to make the applications useful and pleasant
              to use for a wider range of users, including non-technical folks like project
              managers, finance, and marketing personnel. To achieve this goal, I worked on building
              and enhancing several UI dashboards, including the notifications, work pool, and work
              queue pages, from scratch.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to these pages, I also worked on the development of various components
              that improved other parts of the applications. For example, I built the main
              scatterplot using D3 for visualizing data flow. Another significant feature I worked
              on was audit logs, a paid feature used to track workspace user activity for Prefect
              Cloud.
            </p>

            <p>
              To build these applications, I utilized various tools and technologies, including Vue,
              TypeScript, Tailwind, and asynchronous programming techniques. I also worked with API
              to integrate the application with other services.
            </p>

            <p>
              Throughout the development process, I aimed to make the applications efficient and
              visually appealing. The final products were both functional and aesthetically
              pleasing, delivering on the project's goal of making data flow control more efficient
              and user-friendly for our clients.

          <template #header> Prefect Design | Prefect UI Library | Vue Charts </template>
          <template #content>
            <p>
              As part of my work at Prefect, I contributed to the development of several component
              libraries that were used in Prefect Cloud and Prefect Server. These included Prefect
              Design, Prefect UI Library, and Vue Charts.
            </p>

            <p>
              Prefect Design is an open source component library based on the Tailwind CSS
              framework. It contains a wide range of different components, including buttons,
              tables, forms, and more. This library was built to be highly flexible and
              customizable, making it suitable for a variety of different use cases.
            </p>

            <p>
              Prefect UI Library, on the other hand, is a component library that was specifically
              designed for use in Prefect products. It contains key components that are critical to
              the functionality of the products, as well as more complex and technical components
              that are unique to Prefect. This library was built with Vue and TypeScript, and is
              based on Prefect Design.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, Vue Charts is a charting package that was developed using the D3 and Vue
              frameworks. While this package can be used independently, it was specifically designed
              to meet the needs of Prefect products. The charts are highly customizable and can be
              easily integrated into other Vue-based applications.
            </p>

            <p>
              Overall, these component libraries were built with love and attention to detail, using
              a combination of Vue, TypeScript, and Tailwind. They played a critical role in making
              Prefect Cloud and Prefect Server both functional and aesthetically pleasing, and
              helped to ensure that the user experience was both efficient and user-friendly.

              During my time at Carahsoft, I had the opportunity to work on two major projects:
              Carahsell CRM and the Carahsoft website. Both projects required me to utilize my
              skills in C#, MySQL, .NET, HTML, and CSS.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the Carahsell CRM project, I was responsible for developing and implementing new
              features, optimizing existing code, and fixing bugs. I worked closely with the project
              team to ensure that the final product met the needs of the client and exceeded their
              expectations. Through this project, I gained experience in developing and maintaining
              large-scale enterprise software applications.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the Carahsoft website project, I collaborated with the marketing team to design and
              implement website features and improvements. I was responsible for writing clean,
              efficient, and reusable code to ensure that the website was responsive and visually
              appealing.

            <p>
              History Reconsidered is my first independent project, and it holds a special place in
              my heart as it was my personal challenge and a great learning opportunity. It's a
              fully functioning history blog that I built using Vue.js framework for the first time.
              The website has a modern and responsive design, and it allows users to browse and read
              historical articles.
            </p>

            <p>
              Throughout the development process, I honed my skills in Vue.js, HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript, and learned how to leverage the framework's capabilities to create a

          <template #content>
            <p>
              Let's Hang, or Hangman, is a classic word-guessing game that challenges players to
              guess as many hidden words as possible before running out of tries. Originally created
              as the first project for my GA WDI program, the initial version had limited
              functionality and numerous bugs. However, after months of studying and practice, I
              rewrote the game from scratch, resulting in a fully functional, visually appealing,
              and well-structured game.
            </p>

            <p>
              The game is based on simple JavaScript logic and incorporates a words-API to provide a
              wide variety of dictionary-based words for players to guess. Additionally, the game
              features basic SVG animation, adding a touch of fun and interactivity.
            </p>

            <p>
              With its sleek design and smooth functionality, Let's Hang is a testament to my
              passion for coding and my dedication to continuous learning and improvement.

            <p>
              Pig Game is a fun and engaging dice game that challenges players to make strategic
              decisions about whether or not to risk their current points for the possibility of
              earning even more. The game is designed to be simple and intuitive, with the goal of
              being the first player to reach a target score.
            </p>

            <p>
              I created Pig Game as a project for the Complete JavaScript Course, and it was a
              resounding success from the start. Throughout the development process, I was able to
              deepen my understanding of JavaScript and its various features, as well as experiment
              with CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the things I enjoyed most about working on Pig Game was the opportunity to
              explore the logic behind game development. I had to think carefully about the
              different possible outcomes of each roll and design the game accordingly, which
              allowed me to hone my problem-solving and critical thinking skills.

          <template #content>
            <p>
              Natours, Trillo, and Nexter are three web development projects that I completed during
              my Advanced CSS and Sass course. These projects were designed to help me hone my
              skills in advanced CSS techniques, such as animations, grids, and flexboxes. Through
              these projects, I had the opportunity to experiment with CSS features and learn how to
              use them to create visually appealing and responsive websites.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the key takeaways from these projects was learning how to use Sass, a CSS
              preprocessor that allows for a more efficient workflow. Additionally, I learned how to
              use the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology to write clean and reusable code,
              which is essential for creating maintainable and scalable websites.
            </p>

            <p>
              Overall, these projects were instrumental in my growth as a web developer, and I am
              proud of what I was able to accomplish. I am excited to continue building upon these
              skills and applying them to future projects.

              Am I really showing off my portfolio within my portfolio? Yes, I am, and I'm not
              ashamed to admit it! Why? Because I poured my heart and soul into this masterpiece
              using the magical powers of HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Vue.js, TypeScript, and humor. It's
              not just some simple website -- it's a reflection of who I am as a developer and the
              skills I bring to the table.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, if you're here checking out my portfolio, you're not just seeing a collection of
              projects -- you're seeing a showcase of my programming prowess! Each line of code is a
              carefully crafted work of art, designed to make your browsing experience as smooth as
              butter. And let's be honest, browsing through my portfolio is a lot more fun than
              scrolling through social media for the millionth time.
            </p>
            <p>
              So take a look around and get to know me better as a developer. Who knows, you might
              just discover a newfound appreciation for the power of code!
